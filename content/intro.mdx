###### I appreciate you taking the time to come check out this site I built.  Since you're here, I'm going to assume you know my name is Ted Gusek, and that I'm a software engineer.  What you may not know about me is that I love to work on bicycles, coffee has replaced the blood in my veins, and I love getting out to art galleries and making art.  I have two kids that are my world, and I'm based in Brooklyn, NY.  Please take a look around the site to see some projects I have worked on, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to learn more, or just say hey!
